                <p class="p1">Originally from Seattle, I have 3 sibling- including a identical brother.  In 2001 I graduated with a degree in Biology from the Univeristy of Washington.  After graduting, I moved to Boulder to persue my passion for rock climbing.</p>
                <p>I worked a as lab technician and climbed as much as possible.  In 2013, my girlfriend and I moved to Knoxville, TN so she could attend PA School. </p>
                <p >After three long years in the South, we decided to move back West.  Salt Lake had the perfect mix of an affordable town with lots of access to the mountains.</p>
                <p>Now I am starting a new chapter in life- coding.</p>
